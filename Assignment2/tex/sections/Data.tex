\section{Data}

The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database}{\texttt{MNIST}} dataset is loaded using \href{https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets/mnist/load_data}{\texttt{TensorFlowâ€™s Keras}}.
\verb|tf.keras.datasets.mnist| gives the split into \verb|train| and \verb|test| already.\\
The pixel values of the images are \textbf{normalized} by dividing by $255$. This scales the pixel values to a range between $0$ and $1$, where $0$ represents black, $1$ represents white, and values in between represent various shades of gray. Since the image is black and white, it has only $1$ channel.
